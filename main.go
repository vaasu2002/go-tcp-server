// TCP    - most reliable way for machines to communicate over a network
// Socket - abstraction(logical entities which wraps entier communication specifics) provided by OS to enable communication(end points for two way communication)
// TCP Server - a process that runs in a machine that listens to a port that understands TCP
// any machine that needs to talk with a server needs to connect to the port and establish connection

// Step1 - listening on a port
// Step2 - wait for client to connection(we will use accept system call which is a blocking system call so server could not proced until some client connects)
// Step3 - Read the request and send the response (read and write system call are blocking)
// Step4 - Continuouly waiting for client to connect with the tcp server(will use infinite loop here)
// We can currently process only one request at a time
// Step5 - Handling multiple request concurrently 
// Running in parallel
// Once a client connects, fork a thread to process and respend, main thread should came back to accept as soon as possible

// A client connects â†’ the accept() system call returns a new socket for communication with that client.
// Immediately after that we will creare a new Thread to (read clients req, process it, send response and close the connection(socket))
// Meanwhile, the main thread (the one that called accept()) should not handle the client directly. Instead, it goes right back to calling accept() again to wait for the next client.
